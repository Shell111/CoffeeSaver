## Planning
The idea behind this app is to record the coffees (or other regularly purchased item) that you decide not to buy. It's both a habit tracker, and visual reward system, that encourages you to save regular purchases and see the balance of what you're not spending increase. It aims to provide motivation around changing habits and noticing how small expenses can quickly add up
